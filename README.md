# Inchoate
A text based adventure game taking inspiration from games similar to *Dungeon* and *Zork*, 
both of which saw their conception in the 1970s. This is not meant to be a faithful recreation
of those games and neither is it supposed to come even close to stepping into the realm that
these legendary games have occupied. Hopefully this can serve as a mix between a pastiche and
a satirical imitation by way of paying tribute to these games in a cheap imitative way while
also maybe being a ticket to memory lane. But in a world of higher production value, this
project will inevitably disappear in the shadows of the giants.
 
## Story
Ha, you wish! There is no real story. Just go save the princess or something...

## Disclaimer?
Place names from League of Legends was used because I am not creative. Please don't sue me.
I also included some items which have references to other franchises. Once again, please don't sue me.
Hopefully this is temporary, but an actual story board may be created in the design phase, or 
it may continue down this trajectory of randomness.
