# Inchoate
A text based adventure game taking inspiration from text based games similar to [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork).
 
## Story
Ha, you wish! There is no real story. Just go save the princess or something...

## User Stories
To reduce redundancy:  
As a user, I want to be able to...

### Phase 1: Basic Model and Interaction
- Inventory/Items
    - [X] Add/remove item(s) to/from inventory
    - [X] View inventory
- Map/Rooms
    - [X] Move between rooms
    - [X] Get room info
    - [X] See items in rooms
    - [X] Locked rooms (requires specific event/item)
    - [X] Riddles in rooms which grant access to locked rooms
### Phase 2: Data Persistence
- [X] Save game to a save file
- [X] Load game from a save file
- [X] Option to start new game or load game on startup
- [X] Option to save game on quit
### Phase 3: GUI
- [X] Text field to allow access to phase 1 and 2 user stories, similar to console
- [X] Auto suggestion of valid commands
- [X] Buttons for saving and loading
- [X] Buttons to add/drop all to/from inventory
- [X] Play a sound on button press
### Phase 4: Design

These are the basic commands. Some commands may have sub 
commands such as `save` and `load` that become available. Their usage is self explanatory since it
will be shown to you the available commands.
- Typing a cardinal direction (`north`, `east`, `south`, `west`), lets you move in that direction.
- To access your inventory, type `inventory`.
- To attempt a riddle in a room (if available), type `riddle`.
- `here` to see information about a room.
- You can `search` for available items in a room.
- Type `take` then the item name to add it to your inventory. For example if you have an item `item`,
you can type `take item` to take it.
- `drop` to do the opposite of `take`, i.e. removing an item from your inventory and 
placing it in the room.
- `save` and `load` to save and load. You can choose any of the save files 1, 2, or 3. Those
options will become available after typing in the save or load command. 
Save file 0 is reserved for the quick save functionality present in the GUI.


## Instructions for Grader
- You can generate the first required event by using the text field.
There are some items directly one room `west` of the starting room. 
You can `take` and `drop` the items.
See the [User Manual](#user-manual) on viewing the inventory and any items in a room.
- You can generate the second required event by clicking on the buttons labelled
`Take All` and `Drop All`.
- You can trigger my audiovisual component by clicking on any of the buttons. 
It will play a click sound.
- You can save and reload the state of my application by clicking on the `Quick Save` or `Quick Load` buttons. 
You can also save and load by using the text field. 
See the [User Manual](#user-manual) on saving and loading.

## Phase 4: Task 2
- Robust classes
    - Inventory
    - Riddle
    - Player
    - SaveFileHandler
- Map interface - this was done more as a bonus since I saw that it is useful for the **Inventory** class holding items,
instead of using a list.

## Phase 4: Task 3
- Cohesion and coupling between Player class and map + room class. More of the **move** method implementation should be delegated to either
the map class, since some of these functionalites should be implemented in either the map or room class.
This also helps with coupling as it lessens the breakage dependencies in the implementation.
- Cohesion and coupling between Player class and Inventory class. Specifically, the hasItem methods. See above.
- Everything in the ui package haha. Coupling is of medium seriousness. It is of semantic coupling since it
relies on methods and fields returning/being of certain types. For example, when I refactored inventory class
to use a Map to hold the items instead of a list, it caused breakage before compile time. Simpling going 
through the error list made the switch very smooth.
